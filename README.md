3. Choose the production line or select "Todos" for all lines.
4. Click "Aplicar Filtro" to view the filtered results.

### MTBF Information

- The MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures) is displayed for each production line.
- Click the info button next to the MTBF label for a detailed explanation.

### Detailed Messaging

- Log detailed messages for each incident by selecting "AÃ±adir Detalles" after confirming an incident.
- View all logged messages under the "Mensajes detallados" tab.

### Pending Incidents

- Incidents marked as "Fixing" or "Pendiente" are tracked separately.

- These details are saved and can be reviewed later.

### State Persistence

- The state of incidents, including their statuses and details, is saved when the application is closed.
- The MTBF data is also saved and reloaded on startup to maintain consistency.

## Configuration

### Excel Integration

- To select an Excel file for logging incidents, click on "Seleccionar Archivo Excel" and choose your file.
- The application will read from and write to this file to keep track of incident data.

## Hidden Features

### Detailed Messaging Tab

- An additional tab named "Mensajes detallados" allows users to log and view detailed messages for each incident, providing deeper insights into each issue.

### MTBF Timer Reset

- The MTBF data resets every 24 hours to ensure fresh calculations, reflecting the latest operational conditions.

### State Persistence

- The application saves the current state of incidents and MTBF data when closed, ensuring no data is lost between sessions.
